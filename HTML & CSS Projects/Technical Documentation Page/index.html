            <article><p>Python is developed by Guido van Rossum. Guido van Rossum started implementing Python in 1989. Python is a very simple programming language so even if you are new to programming, you can learn python without facing any issues.</p>
            <p>What can Python do?</p>
            <ul><li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li></ul>

            <article>
            <ul><li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
            <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li></ul>
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            <p>Copy and paste this code in your compiler to see Hello, World!</p>

            <article><p>Python Install
                <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
                To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p> 
                <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code> 
                <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:</p>
                <code>python --version</code> 
                <p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank"></a>https://www.python.org/</p></p>
                <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
                The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
                <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
                <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.
                Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>
                <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
                <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:</p>
                <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
                <p>The output should read:</p>
                <code>Hello, World!</code>
                <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
                <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
                <code>x = 5
                y = "John"
                print(x)
                print(y)</code>
                <h4>Variable Names:</h4>
                <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
                <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
                <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
                <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li></ul>
                <code>
                myvar = "John"
                my_var = "John"
                _my_var = "John"
                myVar = "John"
                MYVAR = "John"
                myvar2 = "John"
                </code>

            <header>Python Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <h4>Built-in Data Types</h4>
                <p>In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
                <code>Text Type:	str
                Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
                Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
                Mapping Type:	dict
                Set Types:	set, frozenset
                Boolean Type:	bool
                Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</code>
                <h4>Getting the Data Type</h4>
                <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</p>
                <code>x = 5
                print(type(x))
                </code>

            <header>Python Lists</header>
            <article>
                <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Lists are created using square brackets:
                    In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [], separated by commas.
                    It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).
                </p>
                <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                print(thislist)</code>

            <article>
                <p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets.</p>
                <code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
                print(thistuple)
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="python_functions">
            <header>Python Functions</header>
            <article>
                <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.</p>
                <h4>Creating a Function</h4>
                <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
                <code>def my_function():
                print("Hello from a function")
                </code>
                <h4>Calling a Function</h4>
                <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
                <code>def my_function():
                print("Hello from a function")              
                my_function()</code>
                <h4>Arguments</h4>
                <p>Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:</p>
                <code>def my_function(fname):
                print(fname + " Refsnes")
                my_function("Emil")
                my_function("Tobias")
                my_function("Linus")
                </code>
